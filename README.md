# 💀

A minimalist countdown clock that reminds you life is short — a modern *memento mori*.  
Enter your birthdate once, and it will display the estimated number of seconds you have left to live. The GUI floats silently on your screen in red text with a black background. Move the widget where you need.

## 🖥️ Features

- 🕰️ Real-time countdown
- 🖼️ GUI window
- 💬 Exit message for motivation
- 💾 Remembers your birthdate between runs and picks up right where it should be
- 🔥 Built with Python and Tkinter - but a command line version is also provided in C.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter (`tkinter` is usually included with Python)

## 🚀 Running the App

1. Clone this repo or save the files locally.
2. Run the script:

# Enjoy life until you die.
